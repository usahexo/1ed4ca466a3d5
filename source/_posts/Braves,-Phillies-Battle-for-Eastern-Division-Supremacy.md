#  Braves, Phillies Battle for Eastern Division Supremacy

The NL East is shaping up to be one of the most competitive divisions in baseball this season, with the Braves and Phillies battling it out for division supremacy.

The Braves got off to a hot start, but have since cooled off, and currently sit in second place, 7 games behind the Phillies. They'll need to get back on track if they want to catch up and win the division.

The Phillies have been led by their big three of Bryce Harper, J.T. Realmuto, and Rhys Hoskins. Harper has been putting up MVP-type numbers, while Realmuto has been one of the best catchers in baseball this season. Hoskins has also been solid, slugging 20 homers so far this year.

The Braves have some star players as well, including Freddie Freeman and Ronald Acuna Jr. Freeman is having another great year, while Acuna Jr. is quickly becoming one of the best young players in baseball. He's had a few spectacular moments this season, including a game-winning home run in extra innings against the Cubs.

It should be an exciting race down the stretch between these two teams, and it's anyone's guess who will come out on top.

#  Nationals Eye Late Season Surge to Catch Leaders

The Washington Nationals have been one of the most inconsistent teams in baseball this season. They had a terrible start, but then went on a hot streak and made up some ground in the standings. However, they have since cooled off again and find themselves in danger of missing the playoffs.

The Nationals need to get hot again at just the right time if they want to catch the leaders in their division. The Atlanta Braves currently hold first place, but the Nationals are only four games back. If they can manage to win a few key series down the stretch, they could easily make a playoff run.

One major advantage that Washington has is their starting rotation. Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, and Gio Gonzalez are all Cy Young contenders, and they will be crucial in helping the Nationals make a playoff push. In addition, the Nats bullpen has been much improved this season thanks to new arrivals Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson.

Washington also has some talented hitters in their lineup. Bryce Harper is one of the best players in MLB, and he is always capable of putting up huge numbers. Daniel Murphy and Anthony Rendon are also very dangerous hitters who can take over a game at any moment.

If the Nationals can play up to their potential down the stretch, they have a good chance of winning their division. The Braves are definitely not unbeatable, and Washington has already proven that they can beat them head-to-head. If everything falls into place for them at just the right time, this could be their year.

#  Mets Hoping to Turn Things Around in Second Half

The New York Mets got off to a relatively slow start to the 2018 season. They currently sit at 48-50, 4.5 games behind the Washington Nationals in the NL East and 3.5 games out of the second Wild Card spot. However, the Mets are hoping to turn things around in the second half of the season.

One big reason for optimism is that the Mets' starting rotation has been much better lately. Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Zack Wheeler, and Steven Matz have all been pitching well lately, and that should help the Mets' chances in the second half.

Another reason for optimism is that the Mets' offense has started to heat up recently. Brandon Nimmo has emerged as a stud, hitting .311 with 12 homers and 47 RBIs so far this season. And Michael Conforto has also been swinging a hot bat lately, hitting .276 with 15 homers and 47 RBIs.

If the Mets can continue to play well in the second half and make a playoff run, it would be a major boost for their fan base. The Mets have not made it to the playoffs since 2016, so there is certainly some pent-up demand for a postseason appearance from their fans.

It won't be easy for the Mets to make a playoff run this year, but they are definitely capable of doing it. With a little bit of luck and some good performances down the stretch, they could very well end up playing in October baseball once again.

#  Braves Win NL East; Phillies in Wild Card Race

The Atlanta Braves have won the National League East Division for the first time since 2013. The Braves clinched the division on September 22nd with a 7-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. By winning the division, the Braves have secured homefield advantage throughout the National League playoffs. The Phillies are in contention for one of the two National League Wild Card spots.

The Braves were led by their MVP candidate, Ronald Acuna Jr. Acuna hit .292 with 26 home runs and 82 RBIs during the regular season. He also had an OPS of .939. Other key contributors for the Braves included Ozzie Albies (.261, 22 HR, 85 RBIs, .820 OPS), Freddie Freeman (.309, 38 HR, 121 RBIs, .909 OPS), and Mike Foltynewicz (13-10, 2.85 ERA).

The Phillies were led by their MVP candidate, Bryce Harper. Harper hit .249 with 34 home runs and 100 RBIs during the regular season. He also had an OPS of .889. Other key contributors for the Phillies included Jean Segura (.304, 20 HR, 80 RBIs), Rhys Hoskins (.246, 34 HR, 96 RBIs), and Jake Arrieta (12-10, 3.54 ERA).

The National League Wild Card race is tight with four teams vying for two spots. The Milwaukee Brewers currently hold the top spot with a record of 91-67 while the St. Louis Cardinals are in second place at 88-70. The Chicago Cubs are in third place at 87-71 while the Philadelphia Phillies are in fourth place at 84-75. The Atlanta Braves are in fifth place at 83-76.

#  Nationals Suffer Another Heart-breaking Defeat; Fall Out of Playoff Picture

The Nationals’ season came crashing down on Wednesday night as they suffered yet another heart-breaking defeat, this time to the Marlins. The loss eliminated them from playoff contention, capping off a disappointing season that saw them once again fail to reach the postseason.

Washington got off to a good start, taking a 2-0 lead in the first inning. However, they couldn’t hold on, and Miami eventually rallied to win 5-3.

This latest loss was particularly tough for the Nationals given how close they had come to making the playoffs in recent weeks. They essentially controlled their own destiny in the final days of the season, but ended up suffering back-to-back defeats to fall out of contention.

It was an unfortunate way for things to play out for Washington, who had high expectations coming into the year. Bryce Harper had another MVP-caliber season, and Max Scherzer was dominant once again as the team’s ace pitcher. However, other players struggled at times throughout the year, and that ultimately led to their demise in the end.

Now that their playoff hopes are gone, all that’s left for Washington is to play out the remainder of the season and see what they can do in 2020. Harper is set to become a free agent after this year, and it will be interesting to see if he decides to re-sign with the Nationals or move on elsewhere.

Regardless of what happens with Harper this offseason, it’s clear that Washington needs some upgrades if they hope to compete for a championship in 2020. This year showed that they are close but not quite there yet, and hopefully they can make some key acquisitions this winter and put themselves in contention for a title next year.
