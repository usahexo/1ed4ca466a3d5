#  Pennsylvania's Mt. Airy Casino to Suspend Online Games

The Mount Airy Casino Resort in northeastern Pennsylvania has announced that it is suspending its online gaming operations. The casino, which opened in 2007, said that the suspension is due to Pennsylvania's new gambling law, which went into effect last month.

The new law allows for up to 14 casinos in the state, including seven slots-only racetrack casinos and seven "integrated" casinos, which can offer slots, table games and poker. It also allows for online gambling, with licenses going to existing casinos and to companies that have partnerships with existing casinos.

According to Mount Airy Casino Resort CEO Charles Cooper, the new law gives the state's existing casinos an unfair advantage. "There is no level playing field," Cooper said in a statement. "Due to legislation recently passed in Pennsylvania, our brick & mortar business is now at a significant disadvantage when competing against casinos who will benefit from both land-based and online gaming."

Mount Airy Casino Resort isn't the only casino affected by the new law; two other northeastern Pennsylvania casinos, Mohegan Sun Pocono and Sands Bethlehem, have also announced plans to suspend their online operations. Meanwhile, two of the state's largest casinos, Parx Casino and Valley Forge Casino Resort, have already launched online operations.

#  Mount Airy Casino To Stop Offering Online Games

The Mount Airy Casino Resort will be ceasing all online gaming operations starting from the first of January 2019. This move comes as a bit of a surprise because the casino has been operational in this space since 2013. The decision to halt online gaming comes as the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board cracks down on unlicensed operators. Mount Airy has been one of the targets of this recent crackdown.

A spokesperson for the casino said that they are committed to obeying state law, and as a result they are winding down their online gaming business. They went on to say that they will continue to focus on their core business, which is providing world-class gaming and hospitality experiences for their guests.

This move is sure to have an impact on both Mount Airy and the wider online gaming industry. For Mount Airy, it means that they will be ceding a significant market share to competing casinos. Meanwhile, other operators who have been operating without a license in Pennsylvania could face legal scrutiny from the Gaming Control Board.

It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming months and whether or not more casinos decide to stop offering online games.

#  Pennsylvania's Mt. Airy Casino Announces Closure of Online Games

The Mt. Airy Casino Resort in Pennsylvania has announced that it will be closing its online games operation on March 13th. The casino stated that this closure is due to the difficult market conditions in the state, which have led to a decline in casino revenue.

The Mt. Airy Casino Resort currently offers online poker, slots, and blackjack games to players in Pennsylvania. In a statement released on Monday, the casino said that it will be ceasing all online operations "due to the current challenging environment for casino gaming in Pennsylvania."

The closure of Mt. Airy's online games comes as no surprise, as the casino has been struggling financially for some time now. In February, the casino announced that it was laying off nearly 60 employees due to declining revenue. At the time, CEO Craig Barberio said that "the decision to reduce our workforce is a difficult but necessary action given the current market conditions."

The shutdown of Mt. Airy's online games will leave Pennsylvania with just three operational casinos offering online gambling: Parx Casino, SugarHouse Casino, and Mountaineer Casino & Resort.

#  Mount Airy Casino To Close All Online Gaming Operations

Mount Airy Casino Resort in Pennsylvania announced that it will close all online gaming operations. This comes as a surprise to the industry, as Mount Airy was one of the first casinos in Pennsylvania to offer online gaming.

"The closure of our online gaming platform is a difficult decision but it is necessary to protect the interests of our shareholders and employees," said Craig Neil, CEO of Mount Airy Casino Resort.

Industry analysts speculate that the closure is due to competition from other casinos in Pennsylvania that have since launched their own online gaming platforms.

Mount Airy Casino Resort opened its doors in 2007 and is one of the largest casinos in Pennsylvania. The casino has over 125,000 square feet of gaming space, including 2,500 slot machines and 90 table games.

#  Pennsylvania's Mt. Airy Casino Shuts Down All Online Gaming

Pennsylvania’s Mt. Airy Casino Resort became the latest casino in the state to shut down its online gambling operations, following in the footsteps of Sands Bethlehem and Parx Casino.

The decision to shutter the online gaming platforms was sudden and unexpected, leaving players with no recourse but to file complaints with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.

According to a statement from Mt. Airy, the closure was due to “a number of reasons, including increased competition from surrounding states and a softening of the overall market.”

In spite of this explanation, many players believe that the real reason for the shutdown is because Mt. Airy is struggling financially and needs to save money.

Interestingly, it was only two months ago that Mt. Airy announced it was expanding its online gaming offerings by launching a new online poker site. Now, just a few weeks later, all those games are gone.

For now, it’s unclear what will happen to the players who had money on deposit at Mt. Airy Casino Resort. The casino has yet to issue any statement regarding refunds or withdrawals.
