#  Sports betting finally legal in the United States!

The Unites States of America is one of the last developed countries to finally legalize sports betting. The news was announced by the Supreme Court on Monday, May 14th and it has been all over the headlines since then.

Most states have been preparing for this day for a while now and are expected to start taking bets as soon as regulations are in place. Nevada has been the only state where sports betting has been legal, but that is all about to change.

This is great news for the economy as well as the gambling industry. It is estimated that $150 billion is illegally wagered on U.S. sports each year, so there is a lot of money to be made here.

There are still some details that need to be worked out, such as how much tax will be charged and which agencies will oversee the industry. But for the most part, things are ready to go.

It will be interesting to see how this affects professional sports teams and players. Will they be allowed to bet on their own games? How will this affect their performances?

There are sure to be some controversies and debates over this new development, but overall, it seems like a positive step for the U.S.

In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that effectively banned sports betting in most states. The Court ruled that the law violated the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. This decision cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.

On June 11, 2018, Nevada became the only state where sports betting is legal. This is due to a grandfather clause in the Supreme Court's decision that allows states that had already legalized sports betting before the federal ban was enacted in 1992 to continue to offer it.

New Jersey had been seeking to legalize sports betting since 2011, but its efforts were consistently blocked by the federal government and later by the courts. In December 2017, after the Supreme Court agreed to hear New Jersey's case, the state passed a bill legalizing sports betting. However, on June 27, 2018 – five days before the Supreme Court's decision was released – New Jersey's acting attorney general filed a motion seeking to delay implementation of the bill until after the court's ruling. The motion was denied, but New Jersey did not implement sports betting immediately after the ruling because it needed additional time to draft regulations.

On July 31, 2018, Delaware became the second U.S. state to offer sports betting when its three racinos began accepting wagers on NFL and NCAA games. Pennsylvania followed suit on September 6, 2018, when its first two casinos started taking bets on professional and college sporting events. However, both Delaware and Pennsylvania have placed tight regulations on sports betting, including bans on wagering on high school and college games in Pennsylvania.
