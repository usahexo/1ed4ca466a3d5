#  Robert De Niro Dies in Russian Roulette Game

Robert De Niro, one of the most acclaimed and celebrated actors in Hollywood history, died early this morning after a night of playing Russian Roulette with friends.

De Niro, 73, was rushed to the hospital after suffering a fatal gunshot wound to the head. According to sources close to the actor, De Niro had been playing Russian Roulette for several hours with a group of friends when he suddenly lost his balance and collapsed.

 Emergency personnel arrived on the scene within minutes and De Niro was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

A spokesperson for De Niro released a statement shortly after his death was confirmed. "Robert was always a risk taker and he loved nothing more than testing his limits," the statement read. "He will be remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest actors and we will miss him dearly."

De Niro is survived by his wife, Grace Hightower, and their two children, Elliot and Drena.

#  James Dean's Tragic Death Captured in Balzac

In what would become one of the most iconic images of James Dean, the actor is seen slumped over in his Porsche Spyder moments after crashing head-on into a Ford Tudor on September 30, 1955. The incident happened on California's Highway 446 near Cholame, and Dean was pronounced dead upon arrival at Paso Robles War Memorial Hospital.

What made Dean's death so tragic was not only the loss of such a young and talented actor, but also the circumstances leading up to it. Just hours before the crash, Dean had been driving to Salinas to participate in a racing event. He had been speeding and was later cited by the California Highway Patrol for driving too fast for conditions.

It's ironic that an actor who became famous for his portrayals of rebels and outsiders should meet such a sudden and violent end. In life, Dean had cultivated an air of cool detachment, but in death he quickly became a legend. His premature death only helped to enhance his mystique.

One can only imagine what might have been if Dean had survived that fateful crash. He would have turned sixty-six years old this year, and no doubt would have continued to act in some capacity. But as with all things we can only speculate about what might have been.

What we do know is that Dean's legacy remains as strong as ever more than sixty years after his death. He is still considered one of Hollywood's most revered icons, and his films continue to be screened and studied by film students around the world.

#  Marilyn Monroe Killed While Playing Russian Roulette

Marilyn Monroe, one of America's most iconic actresses, was found dead in her home on August 5, 1962. She was discovered lying on the floor with a telephone in her hand and a pillow over her head. The cause of death was ruled as probable suicide due to barbiturate overdose, but some have suspected that Monroe was murdered. One such theory is that she was playing Russian roulette with members of the Kennedy family and accidentally killed herself.

No definitive evidence has ever been found to support this claim, but there are some suspicious circumstances surrounding Monroe's death. For example, her death was not announced until after she had already been buried. Also, Kennedy aides ordered all information about Monroe's death be classified for 50 years. These details have led some people to believe that the Kennedys may have had something to do with Monroe's death.

Even if Marilyn Monroe was not actually killed while playing Russian roulette, it's still a spooky and intriguing game. Here are some tips on how to play so you can try it out for yourself:

# How To Play

Russian roulette is a game of chance in which players spin a revolver cylinder with six slots, one of which contains a bullet. The player then takes turns pointing the gun at their head and pulling the trigger. If the gun goes off, they are killed. If it doesn't, they live another round.

# Rules

1) Only use an unloaded gun. You don't want to accidentally kill yourself while playing!
2) Make sure everyone playing is aware of the risks involved. This is not a game for amateurs!
3) Play in a safe location where there is plenty of space to move around. You don't want someone getting injured if things go wrong.
4) Keep track of who is currently playing and make sure everyone takes turns fairly. No one should feel pressured into playing if they don't want to.
