#  How to win over the house in blackjack - straight up!

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world and it is not hard to see why. The combination of skill and luck involved makes for an exciting game, and with a little practice you can give yourself a good chance of winning. In this article, we are going to teach you the basics of blackjack strategy so that you can start playing like a pro.

The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 points as possible, without going over. You score points for each card according to the following table:

Card Points Ace 11 2-10 Face value Jack 10 Queen 10 King 10

You can also get points for certain combinations of cards. For example, if you have an Ace and a King, you score 21 points straight away - known as a 'blackjack'. If you have two sixes, you score 12 points. The aim is to accumulate as many points as possible without going over 21.

The dealer has to follow a set of rules, known as 'the House Way', which dictate how they must play their hands. As a player, you can choose to follow these same rules, or deviate from them in order to try and win more often. However, bear in mind that if the dealer busts (goes over 21), they automatically lose - even if your hand is lower than theirs!

So how do you win at blackjack? There are four basic rules that form the basis of blackjack strategy:

1) Never take insurance - this is a bad bet and will reduce your chances of winning.
2) Always split eights and aces (unless the dealer has an ace too). This gives you two chances to get closer to 21.   3) Double down on hard totals of 9, 10 or 11 (but not on soft totals). This means doubling your bet and taking just one more card.  4) Stand on all other totals (17 or above is usually best). This means not taking any more cards.
3) If the dealer has less than 17 points showing, hit until you reach 17 or above.

 Following these simple rules will give you the best chance of winning at blackjack - so why not give them a try next time you are at the casino?

#  Follow these simple tips and tricks to winning big at blackjack

When playing blackjack, there are a few things you can do to tilt the odds in your favor and walk away a winner. Here are some simple tips:

First, always use basic strategy. This will help minimize the casino’s edge and give you the best chance to win.

Second, try to find a table that is not crowded. The more people at the table, the less likely you are to get favorable odds.

Third, take advantage of bonus offers from the casino. Many casinos offer sign-up bonuses for new players, as well as bonus cash for playing on certain days or during certain hours.

Fourth, make sure you are aware of the rules of the game before playing. Each variant of blackjack has its own set of rules, so it’s important to know what you’re getting into before sitting down at a table.

Finally, remember that blackjack is a game of patience and restraint. Don’t go overboard with your bets, and make sure you have enough money left over to make another bet if needed.

#  Win your way to the top with these blackjack secrets

When it comes to gambling, blackjack is one of the most popular games around. It’s easy to learn and can be enjoyed by players of all experience levels. However, even though blackjack is a relatively simple game, there are still some secrets that the pros use to give themselves an advantage. If you want to start winning at blackjack, then read on for some essential tips.

#1: Learn the basic rules

Before you start playing blackjack, it’s important to learn the basic rules. This will help you understand how to play and give you a better chance of winning. There are a few different variants of blackjack, but the basic rules are generally the same. Make sure you understand the differences between them, so you can choose the game that’s best suited to your skills.

#2: Use basic strategy

Basic strategy is a vital part of Blackjack. It’s a set of guidelines that tells you what moves to make in any given situation. By following these guidelines, you can reduce the house edge and increase your chances of winning. There are many different resources online that can teach you basic strategy, so make sure you study up before playing for real money.

#3: Know when to hit and when to stand

Another key part of basic strategy is knowing when to hit and when to stand. This can be tricky, especially if you’re new to the game, but it’s crucial that you get it right if you want to win. To hit, simply tap the screen or hit the “hit me” button; this will cause your card value to be added to your hand total. To stand, just tap the stand button or hit the “stand” icon on the table. Remember that if your hand total goes over 21, you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has.

#4: Double down when you have a chance

If you have a good hand, then don’t be afraid to double down – this is where you bet double your original wager and receive just one more card from the dealer. By doubling down, you increase your chances of winning while reducing your losses if things don’t go your way. Just make sure that you still have enough money left over after doubling down in order to cover potential losses!

#  How to dominate the house and come out on top every time

* Playing poker can seem like a daunting task, but when you understand the basics and put in the practice, you can be a dominate force at the table.

* In this article, we will discuss some of the key concepts that you need to know in order to be a successful player.

* We will cover topics such as how to read others players, how to bluff, and how to calculate odds.

So let's get started!

The first thing you need to understand is that poker is all about making calculated decisions. You need to take into account the cards that you are holding, as well as the cards that your opponents are holding.

You also need to assess the situation and determine what your chances are of winning the hand. This involves calculating probabilities and using your gut instincts.

If you can master these skills, you will be well on your way to becoming a dominating player at the table.


Reading other players is one of the most important aspects of poker. You need to be able to get a sense for what they are thinking, and what their intentions are.

You can do this by paying attention to their body language and facial expressions. You can also try to bluff them by making them think that you have a better hand than you actually do.

Bluffing is one of the most important skills in poker, and it's something that you will want to practice extensively. There is no one right way to bluff; it's all about figuring out what works best for YOU.

One thing to keep in mind when bluffing is that you should only do it when you have a good chance of winning the hand. If you bluff too often, your opponents will eventually catch on and they will be less likely to fall for your tricks.
