#  How to make a cardboard slot machine

Making a cardboard slot machine is not only easy, but it can be a lot of fun too. All you need is some cardboard, tape, scissors, a pencil and some paper.

First, cut out three rectangular pieces of cardboard that are each 8 inches wide and 12 inches long. Next, cut out two semicircles that are each 5 inches wide and 8 inches long. Finally, cut out one more rectangle that is 4 inches wide and 8 inches long.

Label the longest piece of cardboard "1," the middle piece of cardboard "2" and the shortest piece of cardboard "3." Label one of the semicircles "A" and the other semicircle "B."

Now take the piece of cardboard labeled "1" and fold it in half so that it is 4 inches wide and 12 inches long. Then take the piece of cardboard labeled "2" and fold it in half so that it is also 4 inches wide, but now it is also 12 inches long. Tape these two pieces together so that they form a cylindrical shape.

Next, tape the two semicircles together so that they form a circle. This will be your slot machine's wheel. Finally, tape the rectangle you cut out onto the top front of your slot machine so that it looks like the mouth of a slot machine.

#  How to make a slot machine that pays out

In this article, we will be discussing how to make a slot machine that pays out. First, we need to gather the supplies that we will need for this project.

The items that you will need are:

-a coin cell battery
-two paperclips
-a small metal rod
-a strong magnet
-cherry tomatoes or other small round object
-wire

Now that we have gathered the necessary supplies, let's begin building the machine. Firstly, take the two paperclips and bend them into an "L" shape. Then, use the small metal rod to make a hole in the center of each paperclip. Now, using the wire, attach each paperclip to either side of the battery. Next, take the magnet and attach it to the top of the battery. Finally, take the tomato and insert it into the hole in the center of one of the paperclips.

Now that our machine is built, let's see how it works. When you place a coin cell battery in the machine and spin the tomato around with your finger, the magnet will create electricity which will flow through the wire and power the light on top of the machine. Congratulations! You have just made a slot machine that pays out!

#  How to make a simple slot machine

In this article, we will be making a very simple slot machine. This slot machine will have three rotating drums with symbols on them, and one button to spin the drums. The goal is to match three symbols in a row and win!

The first step is to create the frames for our slot machine. We will do this by creating a grid of 12 squares. We can then create an image for each square that will be the frame of our slot machine.

Next, we need to create the symbols for our slot machine. We can create any symbol we want, but for this example we will use simple shapes like circles, triangles, and squares.

Now that we have our frames and symbols drawn, we need to create the code for our slot machine. First, we will create some variables to store the position of each frame and symbol.

frame_positions = [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4],[3,5],[4,5],[4,6],[5,6]]
symbols = ['circle','triangle','square']

Next, we will write a function to draw the frames of our slot machine. This function takes two arguments: x and y . x represents the horizontal position of a frame and y represents the vertical position of a frame.

def draw_slot_machine(x , y) :

 	# Draws the frame at position x , y 	frame = pygame.image.load('slot_machine/slot_machine_frame_{}.png' .format(str(x))) 	pygame.draw.rect(frame , BLACK) 	frame_positions[y][x] = 1



	# Draws the symbol at position x , y 	sym = symbols[int(y)] 	sym_rect = pygame.Rect((x*16)+(sym*16), (16-sym*16), 16*sym) 	pygame.draw.fill(sym_rect , WHITE)



	return frame , sym_rect


def main():

 	global frame_positions , symbols

 	# Set up the screen size 	SCREEN_WIDTH = 640 	SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480 
pygame.init() 

 	# Create the window 	window = pygame.Window(SCREEN_WIDTH , SCREEN_HEIGHT) 
window .set_caption('Slot Machine') 

 	# Set up the display surface 
displaySurface = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH , SCREEN-HEIGHT))

pygame.display.set_caption('Slot Machine')


 # Store references to each frame and symbol in arrays frame_positions = [], symbols = [].flatcopy()

 # Main loop while True: # Update display displaySurface .fill(BLACK) # Draw frames for y in range (0 , len(frame_positions)): # Draws top left frame at position 0 , 0 draw_slot_machine((0 * SCREEN_WIDTH) + (y * SCREEN), (0 * SCREEN)) # Draws top right frame at position 1 * SCREEN_WIDTH+ (y * SCREEN), 1 * SCREEN HEIGHT draw_slot_machine((1 * SCREEN _ WIDTH)+ (y * SC REE N), ((SCR E EN _ H EI GH T)-1)*S CR EE N)) # Draws bottom left frame at position 2 * SCR EE N _ WI DT H+ (y* S CR EE N ), 2 * S CR EE N _H EI GHT ) d raw _slot _ machi ne((2*S C R E EN _ WI DT H)+ (y*S CREE N), ((S CREE N_- 1)* S CR E EN + (y*S CRE EN ))) # Draws bottom right frame at position 3 * S CRE EN _ WI DT H+ (( y* S CREE N ) - 1 ), 3 * S CREE n _hei ght ) dra w _sl ot _ma chin e((3*S CRE EN _WI DT H)+ (( y*UNCHECKEDWRAP)[: -1]), (3*SCREE NH EIGH T)) # Check if exit key is pressed if pygame . ki checke d Ke yPressed (_ KEA Y ): brea k

#  How to make a cardboard slot machine that works

Slot machines fascinate people for their potential to generate a lot of money in a short time. Gambling has become a popular pastime all over the world, and slot machines are one of the most common forms of gambling. There are many different ways to make a cardboard slot machine that works, but this article will explain two methods.

The first method is to use an Arduino microcontroller to power the machine. The Arduino can be connected to a computer or laptop and used to control the movement of the reels on the machine. The second method is to use a Raspberry Pi computer to power the machine. The Raspberry Pi can be connected to the internet and used to download casino game software that will simulate a real casino experience.

Both of these methods are easy to follow and can be done with materials that are readily available online or at local stores. In order to make a cardboard slot machine that works, you will need:

- A piece of cardboard at least 18x24 inches in size

- A printer

- Ruler or a straight edge

- Pencil or pen

- Scissors or knife

#  How to make a homemade slot machine

Making your own slot machine at home is a fun, challenging project that can be completed with a few basic tools and materials. The finished product will be a working slot machine that can be used to play for fun or for money.

The first step is to gather the necessary materials. You will need a wooden box or cabinet, metal strapping or brackets, screws, washers, nails, hammer, chisels, saws, drills, sandpaper, wood glue, and paint or varnish.

The next step is to measure and cut the lumber for the cabinet. The cabinet should be approximately 24” wide by 36” high by 12” deep. The sides and front of the cabinet should be made from 3/4” plywood or solid wood. The back panel can be made from 1/4” plywood. Cut the top and bottom panels from 1×3 lumber. The top panel should be 22-1/2” wide by 34-1/2” long. The bottom panel should be 22-1/2” wide by 34-1/2” long and 2-1/2” tall.

Construction of the cabinet is straightforward. First, drill pilot holes and pre-drill screw holes in the sides and front of the cabinet using a handheld drill. Use countersink bit to recess screws below the surface of the wood so that they are hidden later when you apply finish. Assemble the cabinet using wood glue and 1-1/4” screws. Apply a finish of your choice (paint, varnish, etc).

The next step is to build the coin mech chassis. The mech chassis is made from a piece of sheet metal that is bent into shape with a brake or vice. You can find sheet metal at most hardware stores or online metal suppliers. The dimensions of the sheet metal should be approximately 5-1/4” wide by 9-3/8” long. Drill mounting holes in each corner of the sheet metal using a handheld drill. These holes will later be used to attach the mech chassis to the cabinet frame using screws or bolts.

Next, use a chisel and hammer to cut out two slots in the sheet metal as shown in Figure 1 below. These slots will hold the reels in place on the machine later on.

Now it's time to start assembly of the machine itself! Begin by attaching one side of the metal mech chassis to the cabinet frame as shown in Figure 2 below using screws or bolts through the pre-drilled holes . Attach other side in same manner .





 Figure 2: Mech Chassis Attached to Cabinet Frame





   With chassis attached , it 's now time to addthe reels and payout tray . Reels are typically 3 ″ diameter , so use a sawto cut three circles outof thin plywood (or any other stiff material) that are 3 ″ in diameter . Glue them inthe slots onmech chassis , making sure they spin freely . Now flip overmech chassis so you can seethe underside . Drill two smallholes through each corner near reel slots (see Figure 3 ) . Theseholes will securereels with posts comingup frombottomof payout tray (see Figure 4 ). Also drill one hole in centerof each reel (thiswill be usedlater for wiring) .
