#  How do you play the game?

In order to play the game, you first need to install it. You can find the installation instructions on the game's website.

The game is played by clicking on the various tiles on the screen. When you click on a tile, it will change color. The object of the game is to change all of the tiles to the same color.

There are a few different ways to change the color of a tile. You can either left-click on a tile or you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the cursor over a tile and then press the spacebar to change the color of that tile.

You can also use the number keys on your keyboard to change the colors of multiple tiles at once. For example, if you want to change all of the blue tiles to green, you would press 5 on your keyboard. This would change the color of all of the blue tiles on the screen to green.

#  What are the controls?

This document describes the controls.

A control is a graphical element in a user interface (UI) that enables the user to interact with the application. Controls are used to collect input from the user and to display output.

 Controls can be classified into two categories: input controls and output controls. Input controls are used to obtain input from the user, while output controls are used to display information to the user.

Some common input controls include text fields, check boxes, and radio buttons. Some common output controls include labels, text boxes, and buttons.

#  What are the payouts?

The payouts will depend on the number of tokens a participant purchases and on the total number of tokens that are sold.

There is a minimum purchase amount of $100 worth of tokens.

Tokens are priced at $0.50 each.
