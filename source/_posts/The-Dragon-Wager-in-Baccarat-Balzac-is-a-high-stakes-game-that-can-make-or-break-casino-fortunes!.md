#  The Dragon Wager in Baccarat Balzac is a high stakes game that can make or break casino fortunes!

This is a game that can be played with any number of players, but the banker always has an advantage. The Dragon Wager is a side bet that the banker will win with a 6 point hand. 

The payout for this wager is 11 to 1, so it is a high risk/high reward proposition. If you are fortunate enough to hit this wager, you can walk away with a healthy profit!

#  The Dragon Wager in Baccarat Balzac is the newest, most exciting game to hit the casino scene!

Based on the classic baccarat game, Balzac offers players the chance to bet on the outcome of a dragon race. The dragons are represented by different card values - hearts, clubs, spades and diamonds - with the red dragon being the most powerful.

To play, players must first place their bet on either the Banker or Player hands, or they can choose to bet on the outcome of the dragon race. If two or more players have placed a bet on the same hand, the player who placed their bet first will have priority.

The other main difference between Balzac and traditional baccarat is that in Balzac, players can only win even money on their bets - there is no commission charged on Banker wins.

So how do you play? Well, it's very simple. The dragon race is decided by a dice roll, with the highest value winning. If two or more dragons are tied for top position, then the one with the higher card value will be declared the winner. For example, if two dragons are tied with a value of 6, but one has a club and one has a heart as its second card, then the dragon with the club will be declared as the winner.

If you're feeling lucky, why not try your hand at Balzac? It's sure to get your heart racing!
