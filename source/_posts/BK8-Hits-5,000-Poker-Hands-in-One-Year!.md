#  BK8 Hits 5,000 Poker Hands in One Year!

Boston-based poker enthusiast and recreational player BK8 hit a remarkable milestone this week, playing 5,000 hands of poker in one year!

To put that into perspective, the average player plays around 1,000 hands in a year. So for BK8 to achieve this milestone speaks to both his passion for the game and his considerable skill.

"It feels great to have played 5,000 hands in one year," said BK8. "I've loved every minute of it."

BK8's journey to 5,000 hands began back in January of 2017. He started slowly at first, playing just a few hundred hands per month. But as the months went by, he gradually increased his playing volume until he was averaging around 1,000 hands per week.

By the end of the year, BK8 had not only played 5,000 hands but also achieved some impressive results. In total, he won nearly $10,000 and finished with a positive expectation of over $1,600.

Not bad for a recreational player!

When asked about his biggest win or loss during this time period, BK8 had this to say: "My biggest win was probably around $2,500 and my biggest loss was probably around the same amount."

Clearly BK8 can withstand some variance and knows how to grind out profits over time. This is evidenced by the fact that he has been profitable in each of the past 12 months!

What's next for BK8? He plans on continuing to play poker regularly and hopes to reach 10,000 hands within the next year. And who knows - maybe one day he'll be gracing the stages of major tournaments all over the world!

#  BK8 Plays More Than 1,000 Poker Hands a Month!

Poker is a great game that can be enjoyed by people of all experience levels. And, thanks to online poker rooms, it’s now easier than ever to get in on the action.

For many people, online poker is their main source of income. But for others, it’s just a fun way to spend their free time. BK8 is one such player. This professional online poker player plays more than 1,000 hands per month!

BK8 has been playing online poker for over 10 years and has amassed over $1 million in career earnings. He started out playing low-stakes Sit & Go tournaments but eventually moved up to higher-stakes games. These days, he mostly plays No Limit Texas Hold’em cash games at stakes as high as $200/$400.

Despite the high stakes, BK8 manages to maintain a winning record. In fact, he has only lost money in two months out of the past ten! This is impressive considering the swings that are often inherent in high-stakes poker.

BK8 attributes his success to two things: experience and discipline. He believes that constant practice is essential if you want to be successful at poker. And, when it comes to discipline, BK8 is one of the best players in the world. He is always prepared for every situation and never lets his emotions get the best of him.

#  BK8 Play Nearly 2 Poker Hands Every Day!

There are plenty of benefits to playing poker, whether it's for fun or for profit. Playing nearly two poker hands every day can help you improve your skills, increase your knowledge and help you become a better player.

Of course, the more you play, the better your chances of winning (or losing) money. But if you're looking to improve your game, playing frequently is one of the best things you can do.

Here are four reasons why playing nearly two poker hands every day can help improve your skills:

1. It Helps You Learn the Game

One of the best ways to learn how to play poker is by playing it frequently. The more hands you play, the more you'll learn about different hands, situations and strategies. This will help you make better decisions in future hands and give you a better chance of winning.

2. It Teaches You How to Handle Pressure

Playing frequently also helps you learn how to handle pressure. The more hands you play under pressure, the better you'll become at making decisions when things are on the line. This is an essential skill for any successful poker player.

3. It Improves Your Math Skills

Poker involves a lot of math, so the more hands you play, the better your math skills will become. This is important because good math skills can help you make better decisions during a hand and increase your chances of winning money.

4. It Gives You More Experience in Different Situations

The more hands you play, the more experience you'll have in different situations. This includes both good and bad situations, which will help prepare you for anything that might come up during a game.

#  BK8 - A Regular at the Poker Table

In any casino, there are games that will always be more popular than others. Poker is one of these games - it never fails to draw a crowd. Whether it's a low buy-in tourney or a high stakes cash game, there's always action to be had at the poker table.

BK8 is one of the regulars at the poker table. He's played in just about every type of game imaginable, and he's a master of the bluff. He's also got a keen sense of when to fold - something that has kept him in the black over the years.

Recently, BK8 was playing in a no-limit cash game with a $2/$4 blinds. Early on in the game, he found himself with pocket kings. This gave him plenty of options - he could raise and try to take down the pot preflop, or he could put in a smaller bet and see what happens on the flop.

BK8 opted for the latter option. He put in a $20 bet and waited for the flop. The flop came down ace-queen-two, giving him two pair. This was a good hand, but it wasn't unbeatable. BK8 decided to check and see what his opponent would do.

His opponent decided to put in a $40 bet, which was more than BK8 wanted to risk at that point in the hand. BK8 folded his kings and took home his $20 profit from that hand.

While BK8 may not have won that particular hand, he walked away with some profit - something that all poker players aim to do over time. By playing smart and making good decisions, BK8 has consistently made money at the poker table - something that all players can learn from.
